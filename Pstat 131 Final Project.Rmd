# Pstat 131 Winter 2022 Final Project:

## Predicting if NCAA Basketball players will be drafted based on their stats.

Loading Data Set:
source: https://www.kaggle.com/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021
```{r}
college_stats <- read.csv('CollegeBasketballPlayers2009-2021.csv')
```

# Cleaning the Data

Create a column indicating whether or not the player was drafted

```{r}
stats <- college_stats %>% mutate(drafted = ifelse(is.na(pick), 0, 1))

```

# Exploratory Plots
Making a barplot of the percentage of players from each conference that are drafted.

```{r, fig.width=10}
draft_by_conf <-  stats %>% group_by(conf) %>% summarise(prop_drafted = mean(drafted))

ggplot(draft_by_conf) + geom_bar(aes(x = conf, y = prop_drafted), stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```
