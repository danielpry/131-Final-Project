# Pstat 131 Winter 2022 Final Project:

## Predicting if NCAA Basketball players will be drafted based on their stats.

Loading Data Set:
source: https://www.kaggle.com/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021
```{r}
college_stats <- read.csv('CollegeBasketballPlayers2009-2021.csv')
```

# Cleaning the Data

Create a column indicating whether or not the player was drafted

```{r}
stats <- college_stats %>% mutate(drafted = ifelse(is.na(pick), 0, 1))

```



I'm thinking it's best to have 1 row for each player. Creating a column called seasons for how many seasons they played in college. Then, all the stats could either be averages of all their seasons or just their last season in college. I think it almost makes more sense to make most of the stats be just their last season in college. OR maybe both.

I made a column for the average min_per as well as one that keeps their min_per from that season. Something like ortg, eFG, and TS_per we shouldn't average across all seasons though because thats probably calculated by games and such so each season's ortg would be weighted differently.

IDk what usage is so ill do it both ways for now

The more of these columns I get through the more it looks like going off of the last season (Or maybe the best season) is the only way to do it. 

Going through all of the columns will take a while so I want you guys to take a look first to see if what im doing makes sense and if it's how we want to go about doing it.If it is than ill finish this part another time
```{r}
s <- stats %>% group_by(player_name) %>% summarise(team = team, conf = conf, seasons = length(player_name), Min_per_avg = mean(Min_per), Min_per_last = Min_per, Ortg_last = Ortg, usg_avg = mean(usg), usg_last = usg, eFG_last = eFG, TS_per_last = TS_per, ORB_per_last = ORB_per, DRB_per_last = DRB_per, TO_per_last = TO_per, AST_per_last = AST_per, FTM_avg = mean(FTM), FTM_last = FTM, FTA_avg = mean(FTA), FTA_last = FTA)

s

```

# Exploratory Plots
Making a barplot of the percentage of players from each conference that are drafted.

This plot isn't correct anymore because it includes some players multiple times. Im going to leave it for now because it will be easy to use once we have the data set looking how we want it with one obs per player.

```{r, fig.width=10}
draft_by_conf <-  stats %>% group_by(conf) %>% summarise(prop_drafted = mean(drafted))

ggplot(draft_by_conf) + geom_bar(aes(x = conf, y = prop_drafted), stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```
